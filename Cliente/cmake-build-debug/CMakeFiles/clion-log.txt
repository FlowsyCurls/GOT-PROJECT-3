  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "restclient-cpp"
  with any of the following names:

    restclient-cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "restclient-cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "restclient-cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "restclient-cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
